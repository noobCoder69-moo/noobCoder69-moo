**backend x security dev**

## ðŸ›  what i do  
- write apis that sometimes work on the first try (rare achievement unlocked).  
- patch security holes i may or may not have created myself.  
- vibe-code frontends until css reminds me iâ€™m not the chosen one.  

---

## ðŸ§¾ logs  
- `2023` â€” realized php wasnâ€™t for me.  
- `2024` â€” fought djangoâ€™s settings.py like it owed me money.  
- `2025` â€” backend + security dev arc officially unlocked.  

---

## â˜• current status  
- living off caffeine & stackoverflow.  
- backend > frontend (donâ€™t @ me).  
- can and will spend 6 hours automating a task that takes 6 minutes.
