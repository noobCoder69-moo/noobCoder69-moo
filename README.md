- The system was designed to keep you asleep.  
- The code is bloated. So is reality.  
- Nothing is secure. Not your data. Not your thoughts.  

> _running processes_  
- Watching the world rot in high definition.  
- Hackingâ€”systems, people, myself.  
- Writing scripts to automate the inevitable.  

> _logs_  
- Error 401: Purpose Not Found.  
- Segmentation fault (core dumped).
